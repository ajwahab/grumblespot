# InSync  
(aka GrumbleSpot, thePoint, Indigo Connect) A free alternative to paid services like Humble Dot that is based on Google Forms and powered by Apps Script.

## Features
- Scheduled invitations for form-based updates are sent out to team members (Monday and Friday morning).
- Scheduled summaries of team members' updates is sent out to team members  (Monday and Friday afternoon).
- Summaries include convenient pre-populated mailto links for sending feedback to individual team members about specific items.
- Flexible and extensible Apps Script/JavaScript back-end.
- Easy form-based system for adding one-off questions to upcoming updates.
- Prior to sending out a summary email, the script stores questions and results in a record, for posterity.

## Benefits
- No need to log in to third party services if your team already uses G Suite.
- Data is stored in Google Forms and Google Sheets, so if your team already trusts G Suite, then there is no need to worry about the security of sensitive project data being stored on third-party servers.
- Free = no monthly per-user fee for an essentially simple service.

## Set-up
1. Create a [Google Script](script.google.com) project.  
   1. Copy the contents of *Code.gs* into the script editor.  
   1. Run the ``bootstrap`` function to generate a new registry, link it to the script via the script properties, and create a form to add one-off questions.
      1. Set up the registry; this will store configuration parameters including email addresses, questions that will be asked during every update, and a record of past questions and responses.  
         1. Open the new registry (*insync_registry*) in [Google Sheets](sheets.google.com).  
         1. Navigate to the *email* sheet and add user email addresses to the column labeled *team_email_addresses*.  
   1. Back in the script editor, navigate to Edit â†’ Current project's triggers. Create a time trigger for either a Monday or Friday morning invitation to fill the update form.  From this point on, the script will perpetually delete and create triggers as needed. 
1. Share the form to add one-off questions by opening *insync_add_question* in [Google Forms](forms.google.com) and sending to those who should have the ability to add questions. ![](./img/ss_form_add_question.png)
